# Contributing to Enform

### 👏 Thank you for contributing

We are all busy with jobs, family or hobbies, but also want to spend some time on open source. Time is limited resource, though, so this short guide is here to make contribution productive:

### ⌨︎ Working with the codebase
Before opening a PR:
 - check if what you are planning to work on is in [open issues](https://github.com/moubi/enform/issues)
 - if not, open a new one and attach some labels *(check below)*
 - if it's there - join the discussion
 - go ahead with your PR

#### 🐞 Bug report
If you are about to open new bug report issue try to be more specific about things like **version, browser, OS, steps**. Don't forget to attach the <kbd>bug</kbd> label.

Ideally, provide codesandbox example 🙏. [Fork the basic demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/basic-form-with-enform-dv69b) if that will make it easy for you. More examples to fork from are available on [docs page](docs/index.md#documentation).

#### 💡 Feature request
It is good to start working on new features based on issues/discussion and not opened PR in order to avoid closing irrelevant ones. Creating an issue with <kbd>feature request</kbd> label is a good starting point.

### ❓ If you have a question
Check the [docs](docs/index.md#documentation) first. May be you will find the answer there. How about the [open issues](https://github.com/moubi/enform/issues) - did someone already ask the same?
**If not feel free to create new issue and attach the <kbd>question</kbd> label.**

### 🏷 Issue labels/tags
Mark your issues with the following lables where it make sense:
 - <kbd>bug</kbd> - for bug reports
 - <kbd>feature request</kbd> - if you want that functionality
 - <kbd>question</kbd> - want to ask about something
 - <kbd>help wanted</kbd> - if you need help with the code
 - <kbd>discussion</kbd> - anything that you would like to bring in

 All supported labels are [listed here](https://github.com/moubi/enform/labels).
